Goal: Get a sense of what I want this experiment to actually be.

I. I need to perform "regimes" of analyses for the three phases (Q, G1, G2/M):
    1. Regime #1: Fine-resolution analyses of cis contacts on XII  #CANCEL 2023-1025
    2. Regime #2: Coarse-resolution analyses of the following:  #TODO 2023-1025
        a. XII cis contacts: fithic -x "intraOnly"  #CANCEL 2023-1025
        b. XII rDNA cis and trans contacts: fithic -x "all"  #TODO #CHANGE 2023-1025 From "XII cis" to "XII rDNA cis"
        c. whole genome: fithic -x "interOnly"  #CANCEL 2023-1025

II. What needs to happen?
    0. Using a test file, build out and test all of the steps of the workflow.
        a. Currently, things run up to the successful completion of the call to `fithic`, but more things need to happen after that. What are they?
            i. visualize-UCSC.sh (Post-processing. Visualizes Fit-Hi-C interactions on the UCSC Genome Browser)
            ii. createFitHiCHTMLout.sh (Post-processing. Generates HTML page describing Fit-Hi-C run)
            iii. merge-filter.sh (Post-processing. Filters Fit-Hi-C interactions and merges nearby ones using FANCY GRAAAAAAAAAAAPH magic)
        b. Priorities
            i. Running merge-filter.sh is a high priority  #DONE Does not work; needs debugging
            ii. Running visualize-UCSC.sh is a lower priority  #DONE Not necessary; wrote custom processing code
            ii. Running createFitHiCHTMLout.sh is not a priority, so cut it if matplotlib bugs are encountered  #DONE Not important or necessary
        c. #DONE Flesh out remainder of workflow using a test file, test conditions, etc.  #DONE genome-trans|interOnly  #DONE cis|intraOnly

    1. Regime I.1 requires that 11_cooler_XII_KR-filt-0.4/ contains files at the following resolutions: #DONE
        - 50
        - 100
        - 150
        - 200
        - 300
        - 400
        - 500

    2. Regime I.2.a requires that 11_cooler_XII_KR-filt-0.4/ contains files at the following resolutions: #DONE
        - 800
        - 1600
        - 3200
        - 5000
        - 6400
        - 12800
        a. These need to be converted from .hic files in 10_fanc_XII_KR-filt-0.4/  #DONE
        b. Before running the workflow, check that the bedpe file can be used with IGV  #DONE
        c. Run the FitHiC2 workflow on the hic-to-cool files (outdirectory: 13_FitHiC2_XII_KR-filt-0.4/)

    3. Regarding Regime I.2.b: I think the easiest thing to do here will be the following:
        a. Complete the tasks for I.2.a above
        b. Copy the ia files from 13_FitHiC2_XII_KR-filt-0.4/ to a new experiment directory: 13_FitHiC2_XII-cis-trans_KR-filt-0.4/
        d. Filter the copied-over ia files to retain only XII-associated cis and trans interactions; give the filtered ia files new names
            i. 13_FitHiC2_XII-cis-trans_KR-filt-0.4/
        e. Using the filtered ia files, run the FitHiC2 workflow
            i. 13_FitHiC2_XII-cis-trans_KR-filt-0.4/

#TEST Hopefully it works
We need to add an intermediate step in which, from the ia, frag, and bias files, we need to...
- Exclude any rows containing the string "Mito"
